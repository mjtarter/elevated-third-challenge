# Elevated Third Code Challenge


# Theme

I created my own custom theme for this code challenge. Some important WP files are missing, but all files necessary to complete the challenge are included.

## Plugins

-Advanced Custom Fields

-Events (plugin that I created to display the events)

-Post Types Order - Allows the backend WP user to rearrange elements on a page

## Site Notes

I did not see any mobile or tablet PSD's but still developed the site to be fully responsive. I also used the bootstrap framework and SlickNav plugin for displaying the mobile menu.

## Site Setup

Download et-dev.tar.gz. All WP files are included in et-dev-challenge folder. To setup DB, import et-dev-challenge/code-challenge.sql.
